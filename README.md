## S.O.L.I.D. Principles<a name="paragraph1"></a>
Helps to write quality code which is easy to maintain, understand and extend. Following these principles while creating software will help is reduce code smell and complexity.

- S : Single Responsibility Principle
  - Class should have only one reason to change or only one responsiblity
- O : Open / Close Principle
  - Open for extension and close for modification
- L : Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Subclass should extend all the functionality of parent class and should not narrow it donw
- I : Interface Segmented/Seggregation Principle
  - Interface should be in such way that, implementing classes should not have to implement unnecessary methods
- D : Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Class should depend on interface instead of concrete class

## Design Patterns<a name="paragraph2"></a>
A well-described solution to a common software problem.

Java design patterns are divided into three categories - creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

### Creational Design Patterns<a name="subparagraph1"></a>
Creational design patterns provide solutions to instantiate an Object in the best possible way for specific situations.

### Structural Design Patterns<a name="subparagraph2"></a>
Structural design patterns provide different ways to create a Class structure (for example, using inheritance and composition to create a large Object from small Objects).

### Behavioral Design Patterns<a name="subparagraph3"></a>
Behavioral patterns provide a solution for better interaction between objects and how to provide loose-coupling and flexibility to extend easily.
